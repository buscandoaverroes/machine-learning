# Capital Bikeshare Project
A sub-project that I'm working on and sort of deals with Machine-Learning. Basically, Capital Bikeshare makes all of their historical data public here https://www.capitalbikeshare.com/system-data and I want to see if I can somehow measure the effect of COVID-19 on the system somehow. Take a look and feel free to collaborate.
